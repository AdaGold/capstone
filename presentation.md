# Capstone Presentation

The capstone presentation highlights your application as the culmination of your work at Ada.

It will be __5 minutes or less__ in length and should have the following components:

- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- What are 1-2 things you learned?
  - You should focus on what you learned about programming as an art/craft/profession, not what specific technologies you learned to build the app.
  - Example: "I learned that the best way for me to learn is to try a tutorial out and break everything as I go!"
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: Future enhancements

## Preparing for the Presentation

Before the capstone presentation day, Ada will provide the time table and order of presentations. From this information, you will form groups with the 3-4 people presenting before or after you.

To prepare for the presentation, individually you should do the following:

- Dry run at least twice prior to the demo, in front of someone else
- Know the sequence of events that you will execute to show the features you want to demo
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points
- Have a conversation about any equipment needs
  - If you have a special equipment need that requires more than plugging in your device, confirm with an instructor about the setup. Projects that have more involved setups may be encouraged to not perform a live demo, but to record a video instead

With your presentation group, you should coordinate the following:

- Within the group, designate one or two laptops to use for the presentations. This is to lessen the amount of "plugging in/set up" time in-between presentations so it can go as smoothly as possible
- Make sure the final draft of your presentation is sent to the the designated presentation laptop
- Make sure all presentations, videos, equipment, demos, etc run on the designated presentation laptop
- Make sure the designated presentation laptop has a clear way to navigate between presentations
- Make sure all people know how to to navigate to the next presentation and/or find their presentation
