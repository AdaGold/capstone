# Capstone Project
The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how).

## Learning Goals
- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Learn and implement new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

## What's in This Repo

This repo contains the following things:

Ada's collective wisdom gathered:
- [General Advice](advice.md): a list of advice and wisdom gained over the last several years
- [Advice for Brainstorming](brainstorming.md)

Required Pre-Capstone Material:
- [Picking a tech stack](tech-stacks.md)
  - [Examples](tech-stack-examples.md)
  - In class, we will do the [Tech Stacks Research Activity](tech-stack-research.md) together

Required Capstone Material:
- [Group Accountability](groups.md)
- [Final Presentations Requirements](presentation.md)

Other information we've compiled:
- [What lectures will the instructors give during capstone?](lectures.md)
- [Recommended Reflection Exercise](reflections.md)
- [Useful tutorial sites](tutorials-sites.md)

# Things You Need to Do

## Pre-Capstone: Determine your Capstone Project Concept and Technologies

Your goal here is to determine your capstone project concept and its tech stack.

You have two tasks:

1. Pre-Capstone Ideas Research:
    - Fill out the Capstone Ideas Form with 1-3 ideas
    - Bring this information to an advisory 1:1 meeting
2. Fill out the Capstone Concept Form with your top idea
3. Create a Plan

### Pre-Capstone Research

Use the following resources to begin your research so you can make informed decisions about your capstone ideas:

- [Advice for Brainstorming](brainstorming.md)
- Our resources on Tech Stacks
  - [Definition](tech-stacks.md)
  - [Examples](tech-stack-examples.md)
  - [The Research Presentation](tech-stack-research.md)
- Talk with your classmates
- Talk with the people around you! Mentors, TAs, instructors, family members, friends, etc.
- Every other resource available to you!

When you have 1-3 ideas for capstone, you'll need to record those ideas in the [Capstone Ideas Form]().

Then, bring them to an advisory 1:1 meeting with an instructor. That advisory meeting will be used to talk through any questions of the idea, including questions around scale, risks, and feasability.

If you do not turn in this form and have an advisory 1:1 meeting in time, you may not be able to start the project on the first day of the capstone period.

### Capstone Concept Form

Once you feel that your capstone concept is firm, submit your capstone concept with the [Capstone Concept Form]() by the due date.

Then, the instructional team will review it and approve for you to start your capstone project on the first day of capstone.

If you do not turn in this form by the due date, you may not be able to start the project on the first day of the capstone period.

### Break Week: Create Your Capstone Plan & Begin Tutorials

Three goals:

- Begin the tutorials of some of your technologies (~8 hours)
- Create wireframes for your product if this is applicable
- Break up your project into tasks, and organize those tasks into waves

## During Capstone

### Weekly:
- Demo your progress to your capstone teams every Friday
  - Your PM may attend these demos
- Schedule and attend a 30 minute one-on-one with your PM

### Daily:
- Complete the [daily stand up form]() __everyday Monday through Friday before 12pm, and once over the weekend__

## Final Delivery
The Capstone Project consists of the following components:
- Completed application, live on the web
- The source code of your project on GitHub, with:
  - Clear documentation on how to setup/install your project
  - Any third-party dependencies or configuration required
  - A link to your Trello board
  - A link to your Product Plan
- If your capstone includes a hardware component, you must complete these additional requirements and put them on your GitHub repo:
  - Parts list, with links, for the device(s)
  - A markdown document with step-by-step instructions for assembling, verifying, and integrating the device(s) with your project
- [Project Presentation](presentation.md), a demo of the application and pertinent information about your project

### Accountability Teams
You'll be assigned to a three or four person team. For the duration of capstone, your team members will serve as your sounding board, rubber ducks, and first-responders for your project. You are expected to be responsive to requests for help from your team (within reason), and to utilize the expertise of your teammates when you need help.

### Process Guidelines
- Use your product plan to lead the functionality development of your application
- Create and maintain a Trello board to document progress on your project
- Practice TDD to lead the development process

### Technical Guidelines
- Review the information on [technology stacks](tech-stacks.md)
